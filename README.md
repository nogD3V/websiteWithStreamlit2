#  WEBAPP MADE WITH PYTHON üêç
### WITH SOME CODE, WE CAN CREATE A INTERFACE TO SHOW OUR PROJECTS WITHOUT CONFIGURING HTML, CSS, JS... (OFF COURSE WE CAN USE, BUT IT ISN'T NECESSARY).

Technology used:

Language:
  - PYTHON
  
 Libraries:
  - STREAMLIT
    - STREAMLIT_LOTTIE
  - REQUESTS

**In this WEBAPP we used PYTHON with the framework STREAMLIT to make a simple interface, STREAMLIT_LOTTIE to use animation from LOTTIEFILES, REQUESTS to create a def to consume the URL. We also used some CSS trying to put some style.**
